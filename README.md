# Android Music Player App

This project is an Android Music Player App which allows the user to play their saved music files on their phone and listen to them, the application has some features such as shuffle play, stop, pause, next and previous song, and the user can fast forward or rewind for 15 seconds. The Application is also capable of playing music in the background even when exiting the app or while using a different app. I used Android Studio and Java coding language as my development environment. XML was also used as layout files by default in Android studio.
